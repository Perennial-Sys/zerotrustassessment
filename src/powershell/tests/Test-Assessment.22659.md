Threat actors increasingly target workload identities (applications, service principals, and managed identities) because they lack human factors and often use long-lived credentials. A compromise typically starts with credential abuse or key theft, followed by non-interactive sign-ins to cloud resources, lateral movement via app permissions, and persistence through new secrets or role assignments. Microsoft Entra ID Protection continuously generates risky workload identity detections and flags sign-in events with risk state and detail. If risky workload identity sign-ins arenâ€™t triaged (confirmed compromised, dismissed as benign, or marked safe), detection fatigue and alert backlog allow repeated malicious access, privilege escalation, and token replay to continue unnoticed. Triaging sign-ins closes the loop by recording an authoritative decision on each risky event and driving containment actions such as disabling the service principal, rotating credentials, or revoking sessions.
