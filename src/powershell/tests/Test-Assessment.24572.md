Without device enrollment notifications, users might be unaware that their device has been enrolled in Intuneâ€”particularly in cases of unauthorized or unexpected enrollment. This lack of visibility can delay user reporting of suspicious activity and increase the risk of unmanaged or compromised devices gaining access to corporate resources. Attackers who obtain user credentials or exploit self-enrollment flows can silently onboard devices, bypassing user scrutiny and enabling data exposure or lateral movement.

Enrollment notifications provide users with improved visibility into device onboarding activity. They help detect unauthorized enrollment, reinforce secure provisioning practices, and support Zero Trust principles of visibility, verification, and user engagement.
