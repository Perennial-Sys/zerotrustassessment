When workload identities such as service principals and applications are compromised, threat actors gain persistence and elevated access to organizational resources without requiring user interaction or multifactor authentication. Microsoft Entra ID Protection continuously monitors workload identities for suspicious activities including leaked credentials, anomalous API traffic, malicious applications, and suspicious sign-in patterns. Unaddressed risky workload identities provide threat actors with a pathway to escalate privileges through credential exploitation, perform lateral movement across cloud resources, exfiltrate sensitive data through automated access patterns, and establish persistent backdoors that bypass traditional user-based security controls. Organizations must implement systematic triage processes to investigate detected risks, confirm legitimate activity or compromised states, and apply appropriate remediation actions to prevent threat actors from leveraging compromised workload identities to achieve their objectives within the Microsoft cloud ecosystem.
