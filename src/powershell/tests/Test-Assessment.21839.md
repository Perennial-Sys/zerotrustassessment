When passkey authentication is not enabled in Entra ID, organizations expose themselves to a comprehensive kill chain that begins with credential-based attacks and escalates to full environment compromise. Threat actors initiate attacks through spear-phishing campaigns targeting password credentials, exploiting the inherent vulnerability of password-based authentication systems that can be easily compromised, replayed, or phished from users. Once initial credentials are obtained, attackers leverage these stolen passwords to gain legitimate access to cloud resources, bypassing traditional multi-factor authentication through advanced phishing techniques such as Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) attacks that intercept and relay authentication tokens in real-time. With established access, threat actors perform lateral movement through the environment, escalating privileges by targeting high-value accounts and exploiting trust relationships between systems. The attack culminates in persistent access establishment, where attackers maintain long-term presence through token theft and replay mechanisms, enabling continuous data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and potential deployment of additional malicious payloads. This kill chain demonstrates why phishing-resistant authentication methods like passkeys are critical, as they eliminate the foundational vulnerability that enables the entire attack sequence by providing cryptographic proof of authentication that cannot be phished, intercepted, or replayed by threat actors.
