When passkey authentication isn't enabled in Microsoft Entra ID, organizations rely on password-based authentication methods that are vulnerable to phishing, credential theft, and replay attacks. Attackers can use stolen passwords to gain initial access, bypass traditional multifactor authentication through Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) attacks, and establish persistent access through token theft.

Passkeys provide phishing-resistant authentication using cryptographic proof that attackers can't phish, intercept, or replay. Enabling passkeys eliminates the foundational vulnerability that enables credential-based attack chains.
