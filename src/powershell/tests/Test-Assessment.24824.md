If Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies don't enforce device compliance, users might connect to corporate resources from devices that don't meet security standards. This exposes sensitive data to risks such as malware, unauthorized access, and regulatory noncompliance. Without controls that apply safeguards like encryption, device health checks, and access restrictions, threat actors could exploit noncompliant devices to bypass security measures.

By requiring device compliance in Conditional Access policies, only trusted and compliant devices are permitted to access corporate data. These policies help ensure organizational information is protected from compromise.
