Without a centrally managed firewall policy, macOS devices might rely on default or user-modified settings, which often fail to meet corporate security standards. This exposes devices to unsolicited inbound connections, enabling threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities, establish outbound command-and-control (C2) traffic for data exfiltration, and move laterally within the networkâ€”significantly escalating the scope and impact of a breach.

Enforcing macOS Firewall policies ensures consistent control over inbound and outbound traffic, reducing exposure to unauthorized access and supporting Zero Trust through device-level protection and network segmentation.

**Remediation action**

Configure and assign **macOS Firewall** profiles in Intune to block unauthorized traffic and enforce consistent network protections across all managed macOS devices:
