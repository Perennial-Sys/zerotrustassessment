If Intune policies for attack surface reduction (ASR) aren't properly configured and assigned to Windows devices in Intune, threat actors can exploit unprotected endpoints to execute obfuscated scripts and invoke Win32 API calls from Office macros. These techniques are commonly used in phishing campaigns and malware delivery, allowing attackers to bypass traditional antivirus defenses and gain initial access. Once inside, attackers can escalate privileges, establish persistence, and move laterally across the network. Without ASR enforcement, devices remain vulnerable to script-based attacks and macro abuse, undermining the effectiveness of Microsoft Defender and exposing sensitive data to exfiltration. This gap in endpoint protection increases the likelihood of successful compromise and reduces the organizationâ€™s ability to contain and respond to threats.
