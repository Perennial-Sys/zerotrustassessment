When security key attestation is not enforced, threat actors can exploit weak or compromised authentication hardware to establish persistent presence within organizational environments. Without attestation validation, malicious actors can register unauthorized or counterfeit FIDO2 security keys that bypass hardware-backed security controls, enabling them to perform credential stuffing attacks using fabricated authenticators that mimic legitimate security keys. This initial access allows threat actors to escalate privileges by leveraging the trusted nature of hardware authentication methods, then move laterally through the environment by registering additional compromised security keys on high-privilege accounts. The lack of attestation enforcement creates a pathway for threat actors to establish command and control through persistent hardware-based authentication methods, ultimately leading to data exfiltration or system compromise while maintaining the appearance of legitimate hardware-secured authentication throughout the attack chain.
