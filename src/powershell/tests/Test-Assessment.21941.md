Token protection policies in Entra ID tenants are crucial for safeguarding authentication tokens from misuse and unauthorized access. Without these policies, threat actors can intercept and manipulate tokens, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources. This can result in data exfiltration, lateral movement within the network, and potential compromise of privileged accounts.

When token protection is not properly configured, threat actors can exploit several attack vectors:

1. **Token theft and replay attacks** - Attackers can steal authentication tokens from compromised devices and replay them from different locations
2. **Session hijacking** - Without secure sign-in session controls, attackers can hijack legitimate user sessions
3. **Cross-platform token abuse** - Tokens issued for one platform (like mobile) can be misused on other platforms (like web browsers)
4. **Persistent access** - Compromised tokens can provide long-term unauthorized access without triggering security alerts

The attack chain typically involves initial access through token theft, followed by privilege escalation and persistence, ultimately leading to data exfiltration and impact across the organization's Microsoft 365 environment.
