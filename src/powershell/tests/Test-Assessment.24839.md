If Wi-Fi profiles aren't properly configured and assigned, users can connect insecurely or fail to connect to trusted networks, exposing corporate data to interception or unauthorized access. Without centralized management, devices rely on manual configuration, increasing the risk of misconfiguration, weak authentication, and connection to rogue networks.

Centrally managing Wi-Fi profiles for iOS devices in Intune ensures secure and consistent connectivity to enterprise networks. This enforces authentication and encryption standards, simplifies onboarding, and supports Zero Trust by reducing exposure to untrusted networks.

**Remediation action**

Use Intune to configure and assign secure Wi-Fi profiles for iOS/iPadOS devices to enforce authentication and encryption standards:
