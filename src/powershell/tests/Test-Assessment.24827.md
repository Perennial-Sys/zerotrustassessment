If Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies aren't combined with app protection controls, users might connect to corporate resources through unmanaged or unsecured applications. This creates significant risk of data leakage, unauthorized access, and regulatory noncompliance. Without controls that apply safeguards like encryption, data loss prevention, and access restrictions, threat actors can exploit unprotected apps to bypass security measures and compromise organizational data.

With enforcement of Intune app protection policies within Conditional Access, only trusted and compliant applications are permitted to handle corporate data. These enforce policies help ensure sensitive information remains protected.
