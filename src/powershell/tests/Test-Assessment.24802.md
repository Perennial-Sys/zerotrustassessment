If device cleanup rules aren't configured in Intune, stale or inactive devices can remain visible in the tenant indefinitely. This leads to cluttered device lists, inaccurate reporting, and reduced visibility into the active device landscape. Unused devices might retain access credentials or tokens, increasing the risk of unauthorized access or misinformed policy decisions. 

Device cleanup rules automatically hide inactive devices from admin views and reports, improving tenant hygiene and reducing administrative burden. This supports Zero Trust by maintaining an accurate and trustworthy device inventory while preserving historical data for audit or investigation.
