If Intune scope tags aren't properly configured for delegated administration, attackers who gain privileged access to Intune or Microsoft Entra ID can escalate privileges and access sensitive device configurations across the tenant. Without granular scope tags, administrative boundaries are unclear, allowing attackers to move laterally, manipulate device policies, exfiltrate configuration data, or deploy malicious settings to all users and devices. A single compromised admin account can impact the entire environment. The absence of delegated administration also undermines least-privileged access, making it difficult to contain breaches and enforce accountability. Attackers might exploit global administrator roles or misconfigured role-based access control (RBAC) assignments to bypass compliance policies and gain broad control over device management.

Enforcing scope tags segments administrative access and aligns it with organizational boundaries. This limits the blast radius of compromised accounts, supports least-privilege access, and aligns with Zero Trust principles of segmentation, role-based control, and containment.

**Remediation action**

Use Intune scope tags and RBAC roles to limit admin access based on role, geography, or business unit:
