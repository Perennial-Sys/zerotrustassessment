Enabling the security key authentication method in Microsoft Entra ID mitigates the risk of credential theft and unauthorized access by requiring hardware-backed, phishing-resistant authentication. If this best practice is not followed, threat actors can exploit weak or reused passwords, perform credential stuffing attacks, and escalate privileges through compromised accounts. The kill chain begins with reconnaissance where attackers gather information about user accounts, followed by credential harvesting through various techniques like social engineering or data breaches. Attackers then gain initial access using stolen credentials, move laterally within the network by exploiting trust relationships, and establish persistence to maintain long-term access. Without hardware-backed authentication like FIDO2 security keys, attackers can bypass basic password defenses and multi-factor authentication, increasing the likelihood of data exfiltration and business disruption. Security keys provide cryptographic proof of identity that is bound to the specific device and cannot be replicated or phished, effectively breaking the attack chain at the initial access stage.
