If macOS update policies aren’t properly configured and assigned, threat actors can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in macOS devices within the organization. Without enforced update policies, devices remain on outdated software versions, increasing the attack surface for privilege escalation, remote code execution, or persistence techniques. Threat actors can leverage these weaknesses to gain initial access, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the environment. If policies exist but aren’t assigned to device groups, endpoints remain unprotected, and compliance gaps go undetected. This can result in widespread compromise, data exfiltration, and operational disruption.

Enforcing macOS update policies ensures devices receive timely patches, reducing the risk of exploitation and supporting Zero Trust by maintaining a secure, compliant device fleet.
