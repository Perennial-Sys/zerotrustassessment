If compliance policies aren't assigned to fully managed Android Enterprise devices in Intune, threat actors can exploit noncompliant endpoints to gain unauthorized access to corporate resources, bypass security controls, and persist in the environment. Without enforced compliance, devices can lack critical security configurations such as passcode requirements, data storage encryption, and OS version controls. These gaps increase the risk of data leakage, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. Inconsistent device compliance weakens the organizationâ€™s security posture and makes it harder to detect and remediate threats before significant damage occurs.

Enforcing compliance policies ensures Android Enterprise devices meet core security requirements and supports Zero Trust by validating device health and reducing exposure to misconfigured or unmanaged endpoints.
