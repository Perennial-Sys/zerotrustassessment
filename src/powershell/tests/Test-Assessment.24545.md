If compliance policies aren't assigned to fully managed Android Enterprise devices in Intune, threat actors can exploit noncompliant devices to gain unauthorized access to corporate resources, bypass security controls, and persist in the environment. Without enforced compliance, devices might lack critical security configurations like passcode requirements, encryption, or OS version controls. Without these configurations, there's increased risk of data leakage, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. This gap in device compliance management can break the chain of defense, making it difficult to detect and remediate threats or unauthorized access before significant damage occurs.
