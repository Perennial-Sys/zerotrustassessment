Without named locations configured in Microsoft Entra ID, threat actors can exploit the absence of location intelligence to conduct attacks without triggering location-based risk detections or security controls. When organizations fail to define named locations for trusted networks, branch offices, and known geographic regions, Microsoft Entra ID Protection cannot assess location-based risk signals, leading to increased false positives that create alert fatigue and potentially mask genuine threats. This configuration gap prevents the system from distinguishing between legitimate sign-ins from corporate networks and suspicious authentication attempts from high-risk locations such as anonymous proxy networks, Tor exit nodes, or countries where the organization has no business presence. Threat actors can leverage this blind spot to conduct credential stuffing attacks, password spraying campaigns, and initial access attempts from malicious infrastructure without triggering location-based detections that would normally flag such activity as suspicious. Furthermore, without named locations configured, organizations lose the ability to implement adaptive security policies that could automatically apply stricter authentication requirements or block access entirely from untrusted geographic regions, allowing threat actors to maintain persistence and conduct lateral movement from any global location without encountering location-based security barriers that should serve as an additional layer of defense against unauthorized access attempts.
