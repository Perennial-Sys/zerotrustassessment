# 164: Windows MAM for Edge

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Requires configuration of Conditional Access and mobile app management policies in Microsoft Entra and Intune.

**User Impact:** Medium  
Impacts users on BYOD Windows devices who must sign in with Entra ID and may experience restricted browser actions and separation of work/personal identities.

## Overview

You can enable protected MAM access to org data via Microsoft Edge on personal, unmanaged Windows devices. This capability is known as Windows MAM and is specifically designed for **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** scenarios. It creates a dedicated work browser experience that automatically separates work and personal browsing with distinct windows, caches, and storage locations.

The solution provides three core capabilities to protect organizational data on personal devices:

- **Application Configuration**: Uses Intune Application Configuration Policies (ACP) to customize the organizational user experience by configuring Microsoft Edge settings, homepage, bookmarks, and browser behavior for work contexts.
- **Data Protection**: Controls how data can move into and out of an org context (account, document, location, services) for the user, including blocking copy/paste, downloads, printing, and preventing sensitive data entry into AI tools.
- **Health Checks (Conditional Launch)**: Controls the device conditions required to access org data and the remediation actions if conditions aren't met, leveraging Windows Security Center for device health verification.
- **Conditional Access**: Ensures only policy-managed applications can access corporate resources by blocking unprotected browsers and requiring app protection policies before granting access to Microsoft Entra resources.

If not deployed, organizations risk data leakage through unmanaged Windows browsers, inconsistent policy enforcement across platforms, and lack of device health verification on personal devices. Windows MAM for Microsoft Edge mitigates these risks by extending secure enterprise browsing to personal Windows devices.
