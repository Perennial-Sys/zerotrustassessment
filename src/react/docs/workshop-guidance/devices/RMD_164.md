# 164: Windows MAM for Edge

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Requires configuration of Conditional Access and mobile app management policies in Microsoft Entra and Intune.

**User Impact:** Medium  
Impacts users BYOD Windows devices who must sign in with Entra ID and may experience restricted browser actions, blocked AI prompts, and separation of work/personal identities.

## Overview

You can enable protected MAM access to org data via Microsoft Edge on personal, unmanaged Windows devices. This capability is known as Windows MAM and is specifically designed for **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** scenarios. It creates a dedicated work browser experience that automatically separates work and personal browsing with distinct windows, caches, and storage locations.

Microsoft Edge integrates natively with Intune MAM and Entra Conditional Access to enforce data protection policies on **unmanaged devices**. It leverages **Windows Security Center** for client threat defense, blocks unprotected browsers through Conditional Access, and implements comprehensive data protection controls including DLP integration with Microsoft Purview and **Defender SmartScreen** protection.

The solution uses **Intune Application Configuration Policies (ACP)** to customize user experience, **Intune Application Protection Policies (APP)** to secure organizational data with health checks, and **Application Protection Conditional Access** to ensure device protection before granting service access via Microsoft Entra ID.

If not deployed, organizations risk data leakage through unmanaged Windows browsers, inconsistent policy enforcement across platforms, and lack of device health verification on personal devices. MAM for Microsoft Edge mitigates these risks by extending secure enterprise browsing to personal Windows devices.
