# 115: Co-management Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** **Medium** – Requires project planning and coordination between Configuration Manager and Intune teams, but leverages existing infrastructure.

**User Impact:** **Low** – Affects a subset of users as workloads shift to Intune, especially for compliance and remote actions.

## Overview

Co-management enables organizations to manage Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices using both Microsoft Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune. It allows IT teams to gradually transition workloads to the cloud while preserving their existing on-premises investments. With co-management, you can selectively move workloads—such as compliance policies, Windows updates, and device configuration—from Configuration Manager to Intune.

Key benefits include:

- Enabling conditional access based on device compliance
- Performing remote actions like restart or factory reset via Intune
- Gaining centralized visibility into device health
- Linking users, devices, and apps through Microsoft Entra ID
- Supporting modern provisioning with Windows Autopilot

If co-management is not implemented, organizations may miss out on modern management capabilities, reduced administrative overhead, and improved security posture. Co-management aligns with the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify explicitly"** by enabling conditional access and compliance enforcement based on real-time device state.
