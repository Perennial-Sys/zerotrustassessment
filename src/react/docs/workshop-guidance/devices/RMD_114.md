# 114: Review provisioning strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Requires IT teams to evaluate current device management practices and implement or adjust enrollment methods based on device types and user scenarios.

**User Impact:** Medium — Affects subsets of users depending on the provisioning method (e.g., BYOD users, new hires, or hybrid workers), but not all users at once.

## Overview

When enrolling Windows devices into Microsoft Intune, organizations must choose the right provisioning strategy based on device ownership, user type, and management goals. The four main options are:

- **Windows Automatic Enrollment**: Best for corporate-owned or hybrid Entra-joined devices. It enables seamless enrollment via group policy or bulk provisioning tools. However, it requires Entra ID Premium licenses and is less suitable for BYOD or remote-first environments.
- **Windows Autopilot**: Ideal for provisioning new or reset devices. It simplifies setup and supports self-service deployment. It requires device registration and deployment profiles, making it less flexible for ad-hoc or personal device scenarios.
- **BYOD (User Enrollment)**: Designed for personal devices, this method respects user privacy by separating work and personal data. It requires user interaction and offers limited control, making it unsuitable for corporate-owned devices.
- **Co-management with Configuration Manager**: Enables a gradual transition from on-premises Configuration Manager to cloud-based Intune. It supports hybrid management but adds complexity due to dual systems.

Choosing the wrong strategy can lead to poor user experience, security gaps, or increased IT overhead. Aligning the provisioning method with Zero Trust principles—especially **Verify Explicitly** and **Use Least Privilege Access**—ensures secure, efficient onboarding of devices.
