# 134: Managed Edge Browser for Windows

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Requires IT and Security teams to configure Conditional Access, DLP, and AI policies in Microsoft Entra, Intune, and Purview.

**User Impact:** Medium  
Affects users on both managed and BYOD devices who must sign in with Entra ID and may experience changes in browser behavior, including restricted actions and AI prompt blocking.

## Overview

Edge is Microsoft’s secure enterprise browser built into Windows, designed to support Zero Trust principles and hybrid work. It separates work and personal browsing into distinct profiles, enforces strong authentication via Microsoft Entra ID, and integrates natively with Microsoft security tools like Defender for Endpoint, Intune, and Purview. It enables secure access to corporate resources, enforces DLP policies, and provides AI governance—all without requiring additional software deployment.

If not deployed, organizations risk data exfiltration through unmanaged browsers, unauthorized AI use, and inconsistent enforcement of security policies across devices. Edge for Business mitigates these risks by turning the browser into a secure endpoint.

- **Strong authentication**: Uses Microsoft Entra Conditional Access and authentication strengths to enforce phishing-resistant sign-in (e.g., FIDO2, Windows Hello) and verify device health, location, and risk signals before granting access.
- **Data security**: Integrates with Microsoft Purview DLP and Insider Risk Management to block copy/paste, downloads, and printing of sensitive data—even within AI prompts—across managed and unmanaged devices.
- **Generative AI controls**: Applies browser-based DLP to prevent sensitive data from being entered into AI tools like ChatGPT, and restricts access to unauthorized AI apps. Copilot is governed by commercial data protection boundaries.
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Provides visibility into browser activity, policy compliance, and threat alerts via Edge management service and Microsoft Defender, enabling proactive response and continuous improvement.
