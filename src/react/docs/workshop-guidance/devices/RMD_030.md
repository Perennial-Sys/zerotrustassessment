# 030: Managed Edge Browser on iOS and Android

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Requires configuration of Conditional Access and mobile app management policies in Microsoft Entra and Intune.

**User Impact:** Medium  
Impacts users on both managed and BYOD mobile devices who must sign in with Entra ID and may experience restricted browser actions, blocked AI prompts, and separation of work/personal identities.

## Overview

Edge on iOS and Android extends Microsoft’s secure enterprise browser to mobile platforms, enabling consistent Zero Trust enforcement across all device types. It supports **multi-identity browsing**, allowing users to add both work and personal accounts with complete separation—similar to other Microsoft mobile apps.microsoft

Edge integrates natively with Microsoft Intune MAM and Entra Conditional Access to enforce data protection policies without requiring full device management. It blocks sensitive actions like copy/paste, file uploads, printing, and local saving, and encrypts app-level data. It also supports **Microsoft Tunnel VPN** for secure network access and **Defender SmartScreen** for phishing protection.

If not deployed, organizations risk data leakage through unmanaged mobile browsers, unauthorized AI use, and inconsistent policy enforcement. Edge for Business mitigates these risks by turning mobile browsers into secure endpoints.
